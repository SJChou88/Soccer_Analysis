# Soccer_Analysis

The goal of this project is to predict finishing positions in the top 5 leagues. Data consisting of historical performance of teams and transfer information were scraped from www.transfermarkt.com using scrapy. Modeling is primarily done with scikit-learn packages. The analysis didn't have particularly strong predicitive abilities, but the interesting part was that about every 8 million pounds spent resulted in a point increase in the totals.
